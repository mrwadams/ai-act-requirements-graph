# AI Security Controls Graph

Welcome to the AI Security Controls Graph repository! This project provides an interactive way to explore the OWASP AI Security Threats and Controls Navigator using a graph database. The graph visualisation makes it easier to understand the relationships between different controls, their parent categories, and more.

## Features

- Interactive graph visualisation of the OWASP AI Security Threats and Controls Navigator
- Zoom, pan, and click on nodes to view details
- Search functionality to find specific nodes
- Subgraphs focusing on specific aspects of the AI security landscape
- Attractive color scheme for easy identification of node types

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI Security Controls Graph, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mrwadams/ai-security-controls-graph.git
   ```

2. Open the `ai_security_controls_graph.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab using the <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/mrwadams/ai-security-controls-graph/blob/main/AI_Security_Controls_Graph.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> button.

3. Run the notebook cells in order to generate the graph visualisations.

4. Interact with the graph:
   - Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or trackpad
   - Pan the graph by clicking and dragging
   - Click on a node to view its details in the sidebar
   - Use the search bar to find specific nodes

5. Explore the subgraphs to gain insights into specific aspects of the AI security landscape, such as:
   - Controls that belong to multiple groups
   - Groups that contain the most controls
   - Categories and the distribution of controls within them
   - The relationship between control types and groups
