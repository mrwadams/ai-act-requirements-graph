# EU AI Act Requirements Graph

Welcome to the EU AI Act Requirements Graph repository! This project provides an interactive way to explore the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.com/)'s requirements for Providers of High Risk AI Systems as a graph database. The graph visualisation makes it easier to understand the relationships between different requirements, their parent articles, and more.

## Features

- Interactive graph visualisation of the requirements from the EU AI Act
- Zoom, pan, and click on nodes to view details
- Search functionality to find specific nodes
- Subgraphs focusing on specific aspects of the AI regulatory landscape
- Attractive color scheme for easy identification of node types

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI Act Requirements Graph, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mrwadams/ai-act-requirements-graph.git
   ```

2. Open the `AI_Act_Requirements_Graph.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab using the <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/mrwadams/ai-act-requirements-graph/blob/main/AI_Act_Requirements_Graph.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> button.

3. Run the notebook cells in order to generate the graph visualisations.

4. Interact with the graph:
   - Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or trackpad
   - Pan the graph by clicking and dragging
   - Click on a node to view its details in the sidebar
   - Use the search bar to find specific nodes

5. Explore the subgraphs to gain insights into specific aspects of the AI regulatory landscape, such as:
   - The specific requirements that fall under a given Article
   - Nodes (requirements) that are connected by specific relationship types such as "REQUIRES" or "SEE_ALSO"
   - Identifying key requirements by analysing their degree of centrality in the graph
